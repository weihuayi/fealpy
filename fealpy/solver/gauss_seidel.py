    """
    Solve a linear system Ax = b using the Gauss-Seidel method.

    Parameters:
        A (SupportsMatmul): The coefficient matrix of the linear system.
        b (TensorLike): The right-hand side vector of the linear system, can be a 1D or 2D tensor.
        x0 (TensorLike, optional): Initial guess for the solution, a 1D or 2D tensor. Must have the same shape as `b`.\
        Defaults to a zero tensor if not provided.
        atol (float, optional): Absolute tolerance for convergence. Default is 1e-12.
        rtol (float, optional): Relative tolerance for convergence. Default is 1e-8.
        maxit (int, optional): Maximum number of iterations allowed. Default is 10000. If not provided, the method will\
        continue until convergence based on the given tolerances.

    Returns:
        Tensor: The approximate solution to the system Ax = b.
        dict: A dictionary containing the residual and the number of iterations taken.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If inputs do not meet the specified conditions (e.g., A is not sparse, dimensions mismatch).

    Note:
        This implementation decomposes the matrix A into its upper triangular part (U) and lower triangular part (L),
        with A = L + D + U. The algorithm solves iteratively by updating the solution with forward substitution on M = L + D,
        until the residual norm meets the specified tolerance or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

        This method assumes that the system is well-conditioned for the Gauss-Seidel iteration.
