# AFAP: Advanced Fracture Analysis Platform

## Introduction

Welcome to the Advanced Fracture Analysis Platform (AFAP), an open-source software package designed for the simulation of material fracture and failure. AFAP is entirely based on Python and offers a flexible computational backend that can switch between Numpy, JAX, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. This enables efficient multi-dimensional array processing and leverages both traditional algorithms and advanced AI techniques for high-performance simulations.

## Features
- **Multi-Backend Support**: Seamlessly switch between Numpy, JAX, PyTorch, and TensorFlow for computation.
- **Traditional Algorithms**: Implement classical fracture mechanics algorithms.
- **AI Techniques**: Incorporate artificial intelligence methods to enhance simulation efficiency.
- **Open-Source**: Fully open-source, encouraging collaboration and contributions from the community.
